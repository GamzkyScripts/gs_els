There are quite a lot of ELS-variants available these days, mostly paid versions; which are often overpriced, lacking in features, badly optimized and don't bring an immersive feeling to the drawn lights. This scripts looks to tackle these problems, in a compact and comprehensive way, offering a free open-source alternative for your server to handle vehicle lights and sirens.

## Features
- Vehicle lights and sirens are fully synchronized between players and optimized for performance.
- Immersive lightning, the emitted lights are drawn in the direction of the light source, creating a realistic feeling.
- A comprehensive and compact user-interface, indicating the current status of the lights/sirens.
- Players seated in the front can simultaneously control the vehicle lights/sirens (can also be restricted to only the driver in the configuration).
- Many configurable options, even if you lack programming knowledge, you are still able to change the most important settings of the script.
- Fully standalone, can be integrated into any server. Because it is open-source, you always have full control and can add or remove any feature.
- A debug-mode, which allows you to configure the emergency lights of a vehicle whilst in-game. No need to notoriously configure the positions and directions of a light in the configuration file. The end of the showcase video shows how to fully configure a vehicle.
- Optimized, the script only physically draws the lights of the closest vehicles (amount can be configured) maintaining low resmon. If ~15 vehicles are closeby, the resmon will only be around 0.23 ms whilst still drawing the lights of the closest 5 vehicles (idle is 0.0 ms).
- The light intensity (optionally) adapts to the time, increasing emitted light intensity during daytime to make them more noticeable.
- Hazard and indicator lights are also included and fully synchronized.
- Supports custom (server-sided) sirens.
- Supports key-mapping, allowing individual players to customize keybindings.
